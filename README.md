# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Model
This project builds a simple system that predicts a patient’s risk of heart disease using basic data like age and cholesterol levels. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which compares a new patient’s information with similar past cases and predicts the outcome based on the majority of the closest matches.
